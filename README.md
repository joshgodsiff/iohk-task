# Building

I'm using GHC 8.10.7 and Cabal 3.6.2.0 to build and run this.

# Running

`main` is currently set up to run the example Blockchain problem. It should be trivial to change it the Ping Pong example.

Everything else I've been running / testing via `cabal repl`.

Let me know if there are any problems.
