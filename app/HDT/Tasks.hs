      -- * An @'IO'@-interpreter for agents.
      -- |In order to actually /run/ agents, we need to /interpret/ the free
      -- @'Agent'@ monad. We start with an interpreter in @'IO'@,
      -- which runs each agent in a list of agents in its own thread
      -- and implements messaging by utilizing a shared @'TChan'@ broadcast channel.
      --
      -- We will then be able to run our ping-pong example:
      --
      -- >>> runIO [ping, pong]

      -- * Ouroboros Bft
      -- | We use agents to implement a simplified version of the
      -- <https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-bfta-simple-byzantine-fault-tolerant-consensus-protocol/ Ouroboros-BFT>
      -- blockchain consensus protocol.
      --
      -- Ouroboros-BFT works as follows: A fixed number of @n@ /nodes/ participate in the
      -- protocol. They collaborate on building a /blockchain/ by adding /blocks/,
      -- and the protocol ensures that the nodes will agree on a /common prefix/
      -- (all nodes agree on the prefix of the chain, but may disagree on a few blocks
      -- towards the end).
      -- This will work as long as at least two thirds of the nodes follow the protocol.
      --
      -- Time is divided in /slots/ of a fixed length, and in each slot, one node is the
      -- /slot leader/ with the right to create the next block.
      -- Slots leaders are determined in a round-robin fashion: Node 0
      -- can create a block in Slot 0, Node 1 in Slot 1, Node @(n-1)@ in Slot @(n-1)@,
      -- Node 0 in Slot @n@ and so on.
      -- When a node is slot leader, it adds a block to its current chain and
      -- broadcasts the new chain to the other nodes.
      --
      -- Each node holds on to a current chain (all nodes start with the chain
      -- just consisting of the /genesis block/). When a node receives a new chain
      -- from another node, it checks the new chain for /validity/ and
      -- adopts it as its own chain /if it is longer than its own chain/.
      --
      -- A chain is /valid/ if
      --
      --  * The timestamps are stricly increasing,
      --  * All blocks have been created by the slot leader of that slot and
      --  * The newest block's timestamp is not from the future.
      --
      -- In reality, nodes would use digital signatures to sign the blocks
      -- they create, and each block would contain a /payload/, but we
      -- want to keep matters as simple as possible.
